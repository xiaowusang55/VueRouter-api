# tag

* type: `string`

* default: `"a"`

Sometimes we want `<router-link>` to render as another tag, e.g `<li>`. Then we can use `tag` prop to specify which tag to render to, and it will still listen to click events for navigation.

```html
<router-link to="/foo" tag="li">foo</router-link>
<!-- renders as -->
<li>foo</li>
```
