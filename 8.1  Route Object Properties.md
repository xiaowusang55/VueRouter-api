# Route Object Properties

## $route.path

* type: `string`

A string that equals the path of the current route, always resolved as an absolute path. e.g. `"/foo/bar"`.

## $route.params

* type: `Object`

An object that contains key/value pairs of dynamic segments and star segments. If there are no params the value will be an empty object.

## $route.query

* type: `Object`

An object that contains key/value pairs of the query string. For example, for a path `/foo?user=1`, we get `$route.query.user` == 1. If there is no query the value will be an empty object.

## $route.hash

* type: `string`

The hash of the current route (with the `#`), if it has one. If no hash is present the value will be an empty string.

## $route.fullPath

* type: `string`

The full resolved URL including query and hash.

## $route.matched

* type: `Array<RouteRecord>`

An Array containing route records for all nested path segments of the current route. Route records are the copies of the objects in the `routes` configuration Array (and in `children` Arrays):

```js
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    // the following object is a route record
    {
      path: '/foo',
      component: Foo,
      children: [
        // this is also a route record
        { path: 'bar', component: Bar }
      ]
    }
  ]
})

```

When the URL is `/foo/bar`, `$route.matched` will be an Array containing both objects (cloned), in parent to child order.

## $route.name

The name of the current route, if it has one. (See Named Routes)

## $route.rediretedFrom

The name of the route being redirected from, if there were one. (See Redirect and Alias)
