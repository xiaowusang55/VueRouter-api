# append

* type: `boolean`

* default: `false`

Setting `append` prop always appends the relative path to the current path. For example, assuming we are navigating from `/a` to a relative link `b`, without `append` we will end up at `/b`, but with `append` we will end up at `/a/b`.

```html
<router-link :to="{ path: 'relative/path' }" append></router-link>
```
