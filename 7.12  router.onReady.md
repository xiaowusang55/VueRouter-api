# router.onReady

Signature:

```js
router.onReady(callback, [errorCallback])
```

This method queues a callback to be called when the router has completed the initial navigation, which means it has resolved all async enter hooks and async components that are associated with the initial route.

This is useful in server-side rendering to ensure consistent output on both the server and the client.

The second argument `errorCallback` is only supported in 2.4+. It will be called when the initial route resolution runs into an error (e.g. failed to resolve an async component).
