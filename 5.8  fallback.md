# fallback

* type: `boolean`

* default: `true`

Controls whether the router should fallback to hash mode when the browser does not support `history.pushState` but mode is set to `history`.

Setting this to `false` essentially makes every `router-link` navigation a full page refresh in IE9. This is useful when the app is server-rendered and needs to work in IE9, because a hash mode URL does not work with SSR.
