# v-slot API (3.1.0+)

`router-link` exposes a low level customization through a scoped slot . This is a more advanced API that primarily targets library authors but can come in handy for developers as well, most of the time in a custom component like a NavLink or other.

**When using the `v-slot` API, it is required to pass one single child to `router-link`.** If you don't, `router-link` will wrap its children in a `span` element.

```html
<router-link
  to="/about"
  v-slot="{ href, route, navigate, isActive, isExactActive }"
>
  <NavLink :active="isActive" :href="href" @click="navigate"
    >{{ route.fullPath }}</NavLink
  >
</router-link>

```

* `href`: resolved url. This would be the `href` attribute of an `a` element
* `route`: resolved normalized location
* `navigate`: function to trigger the navigation. It will automatically prevent events when necessary, the same way `router-link` does
* `isActive`: `true` if the active class should be applied. Allows to apply an arbitrary class
* `isExactActive`: `true` if the exact active class should be applied. Allows to apply an arbitrary class

## Example: Applying Active Class to Outer Element

Sometimes we may want the active class to be applied to an outer element rather than the `<a>` tag itself, in that case, you can wrap that element inside a router-link and use the v-slot properties to create your link:

```html
<router-link
  to="/foo"
  v-slot="{ href, route, navigate, isActive, isExactActive }"
>
  <li
    :class="[isActive && 'router-link-active', isExactActive && 'router-link-exact-active']"
  >
    <a :href="href" @click="navigate">{{ route.fullPath }}</a>
  </li>
</router-link>
```

>TIP

If you add a `target="_blank"` to your `a` element, you must omit the `@click="navigate"` handler
