# exact

* type: `boolean`

* default: `false`

The default active class matching behavior is **inclusive match**. For example, `<router-link to="/a">` will get this class applied as long as the current path starts with `/a/` or is `/a`.

One consequence of this is that `<router-link to="/">` will be active for every route! To force the link into "exact match mode", use the exact prop:

```html
<!-- this link will only be active at `/` -->
<router-link to="/" exact></router-link>
```
